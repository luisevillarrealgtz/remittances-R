\section{Research proposal}
    \begin{frame}{Research proposal}
The proposal to carry out the present analysis is based on the review of the literature presented in the previous section and on the methodology used in most of the articles. They were taken as candidates to establish the cointegration relationship of the present investigation to the GDP of Mexico, the GDP of the United States, the real exchange rate, and for obvious reasons to remittances. \par
The data were collected on a quarterly basis from the first quarter of 1996 (1996: 1) to the fourth quarter of 2019 (2019: 4).\par	
In turn, it is intended to perform a cointegration analysis applying the Johansen methodology and once a long-term relationship has been established between the variables, proceed to specify said relationship by means of an Error Correction Model.\par
